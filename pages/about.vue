      The Open-source Beat Saber Hall of Fame Project is a community-driven effort to create a centralized platform for ranking, comparing, and tracking players' progression in the popular rhythm game, Beat Saber. The project is built entirely using open-source technologies and is available to anyone who wishes to use it.

      At its core, the project provides a global leaderboard that displays the top-performing players. Users can also filter the leaderboard by country, region, or friend group, allowing them to see how they stack up against their peers.

      One of the key features of the project is the ability to add friends and track their progress. This feature allows users to follow their friends' progress in real-time, see which songs they've played, and compare their scores. This feature is especially useful for players who want to keep tabs on their friends' progress or engage in friendly competition.

      In addition to the leaderboard and friend tracking, the project also provides a detailed player profile page that displays a player's stats and achievements. Players can see their overall playtime, accuracy, and total score, as well as their progress on individual songs and difficulties.

      Overall, the Open-source Beat Saber Hall of Fame Project is a fantastic resource for Beat Saber players who want to compare rankings, track their progress, and engage with the community. The open-source nature of the project means that it is constantly evolving, with new features and improvements being added regularly, and the community-driven aspect means that it will continue to improve and grow over time.
